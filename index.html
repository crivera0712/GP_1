      <h1>The World Is getting Warmer</h1>
      <p class="summary-p">Global warming is a pressing environmental issue that has captured worldwide attention in recent decades. It refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases, such as carbon dioxide <span>(CO2)</span>, methane<span>(CH4)</span>, and nitrious oxide <span>(N20)</span>, trap heat from the sun, leading to a gradual rise in temperaturea across the planet.</p>
      <p class="summary-p">The consequences of global warming are wide-ranging and profound, impacting various aspects of the Earth's natural systems and human societies. From melting ice caps and rising sea levels to more frequent and severe weather events like hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves, the effects of climate change are becoming increasingly visible and disruptive.</p>
      <p class="summary-p">Moreover, global warming poses significant threats to biodiversity, ecosystems, and human health. It disrupts habitats, alters migration patterns, and contributes to the spread of diseases. In addition, it exacerbates existing social and economic inequalities, disproportionately affecting vulnerable communities and regions with limited resources and adaptive capacity.</p>

        <h2>Who Is At Risk?</h2>
        <p>Both wildlife and humans are at risk due to global warming. Wildlife faces threats such as habitat loss, altered ecosystems, increased extinction risks, disrupted reproductive cycles, ocean acidification, loss of biodiversity, and range shifts. Humans are vulnerable to impacts such as extreme weather events, food and water shortages, health risks from heatwaves and diseases, economic losses, and social disruptions. Addressing these risks requires concerted efforts to mitigate climate change, protect ecosystems, and promote sustainable practices to safeguard both wildlife and human populations.</p>

      <h2>How To Fight Back</h2>
      <p>Individuals and communities can combat global warming by adopting energy-saving habits, like using energy-efficient appliances and renewable energy sources. They can also reduce car usage, minimize waste, conserve resources, choose climate-friendly options, and advocate for climate action. These actions contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting a more sustainable future for our planet.</p>

    <h2>What About Food?</h2>
    <p>Moderate warming and more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may help some plants to grow faster. However, more severe warming, floods, and drought may reduce yields. Livestock may be at risk, both directly from heat stress and indirectly from reduced quality of their food supply.</p>
