Our website is on global warming, an issue that we believe to be very important. Our websites aim is to give a brief description of what global warming is, populations that are currently and will be affected by global warming, and how we as indiviudals can help combat it. 

While making this website a couple thing that we learned that were interesting were how to make card elements with flex box and how to change the color of an anchor tag by hovering over it. 

Here are the websites we used for information on global warming:
